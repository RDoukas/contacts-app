# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Antoinesse", last_name: "Wooley", email: "antoinesse@gmail.com", phone_number: "2197738693")
# contact.save

# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Judy", last_name: "Dawson", email: "CocoChannel97@gmail.com", phone_number: "7738590030")
# contact.save

# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Stephanie", last_name: "DeRe", email: "ArtQueen@gmail.com", phone_number: "7094569903")
