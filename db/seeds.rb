# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

# contact = Contact.new(first_name: "Gina", last_name: "Maloto", email: "GinaPatricia@gmail.com", phone_number: "6305559000")
# contact.save
